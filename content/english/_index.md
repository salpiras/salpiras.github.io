Hi! I am Salvatore, a **mobile software engineer** from Sardinia, Italy currently living in **Cambridge, UK**.

I started programming when I was twelve, scripting for Sphere Server, an Ultima Online emulator, one of my favourite games at the time. The ability to build entire worlds in code from my room in my little town seemed magical to me so much that the feeling stayed with me and later **I pursued a CS degree from the University of Cagliari**. 

During the last semester of uni I started working for a US-Italian music streaming startup, Soundtracker, as an **Android developer**. I met a lot of wonderful people and started learning the art of wearing many hats in a fast-paced environment, but sadly it failed to monetise and the team was disbanded.

What it seemed like a bad turn of events was in practice the Petri dish of one the best opportunities in my life, as it set in motion a series of events for which six months later, in April 2015, me and my now wife **moved to Cambridge**. We didn't really have a long term plan at the time, but here we are now, ten years and counting. In this international and vibrant environment I bloomed as a person and as a professional, keeping my skills broad while **specialising in Android and iOS native development with a seasoning of C++ core codebases and backend services**.

***

I now hold two passports (**Italian and British**) and dream one day to move to Barcelona, the Mobile World capital, where I have some family and spend at least a month a year working remotely (Passeig de Gracia WeWork is a wonder!). You can usually find me around Cambridge either chilling out in a nice pub with friends, trying to learn salsa dancing even though I have two left feet or riding my bike in the countryside (when it's not raining!)
