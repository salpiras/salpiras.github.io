        description: 'At RealVNC I continued growing in all directions and developed into a business aware, multi-team asset T-shaped engineer - 
          while continuing focusing on mobile platforms with **Android systems deep expertise and iOS as a close second**, I helped multiple teams
          around different projects, from C++ core features, to **Emscripten** C++/Javascript product ports and even **Java Spring Boot microservices** and 
          Typescript **Vue.js** frontends for a **WebRTC** browser based remote access solution. 
          
          
          On the mobile front, I proposed, designed and even at times lead entire features and product cycles, maturing greatly in my ability to break down
          features in smaller tasks and **pitch costed features to the product team based on competitor comparison or feature requests**, while coordinating
          communications between teams for cross-functional ones.
          
          
          My latest biggest achievements at RealVNC have been:

          + Advocating for, pitching, scoping, architecting and development of the **Android Remote Control** feature for the RealVNC Server and the release of both the **Android
            and iOS RealVNC server apps**, and their improvements in terms of UX leading to triple digits percentage increases in downloads. 

          + There were no RealVNC mobile servers when I joined so it was an exciting time and a good opportunity to develop my architecture advocacy - both apps
            are based on a modern, testable **MVVM architecture** and use **Jetpack Compose** on Android and **SwiftUI** on iOS. 

          + My passion for **mentoring** grew as well as the team
            expanded to cover these efforts and I onboarded two graduate engineers at the same time in a sistematic way with a **great focus on 1-1 pair programming and teaching notions from first principles**
            with great results thanks to them being brilliant, even setting the scene to some promotions. Kudos to them who know are on the way to master both platforms! There is nothing more rewarding than seeing the growth of your teaching investment both on a business and personal perspective.

      - name: Software Engineer @ Intrasonics
        description: 'Intrasonics was hands down one of the best teams I have ever worked with. Here I matured as a software developer and as a person, and the support I received was unvaluable.
        Its greatest asset as a company is definitely the people - a team full of knowledgable, smart persons who are also very approachable and friendly made the team run through the sprints like a well oiled machine.
        I grew up in all directions during my time here - from starting to master **Android** and **iOS** development to using **C++** for a common code core SDK between the two platforms, 
        to creating an entire **end-to-end test pipeline** for the iOS app and write **Bash** and **Python** build scripts to **mentoring** new hires and **take part in interview panels**.


        Intrasonics is a company that offers audio watermarking and recognition technology. It delivers solutions for content recognition, audience measurement, synchronised streaming, second-screen experiences and audio-triggered toys.
        In 2021 after a long successful collaboration as consultants, it has been acquired by its main customer Ipsos, a global leader company in market research.
        

        My main achievements here have been:
         
         + redesigning and deploying to the **Play and App Store of the MediaCell app** (previously distributed via manual enterprise programs), a passive audio audience measurement app used by major broadcasters, coordinating spring planning and work breakdowns.
         
         + maintaining and actively working on the core **C++ SDK** as we added more features and expanded its audio capabilities

         + setting up an **instrumentation testing environment** with Espresso on Android and KIF on iOS running in a Jenkins CI environment. 
         
         + **interviewing** during the hire process and consequent mentoring of junior co-workers on mobile software development (iOS and Android).
         
         + direct **interaction with major customers**, coming up with **proof of concept apps** tailored on specific requirements (e.g. audio/video streaming sync for Perform Group)
         
         + design, prototyping and development of a space invaders-like augmented reality game set in your living room in C++ using **Unreal Engine and ARCore** based on **audio triggers**

        description: 'This was my first job after arriving in the UK and I felt welcomed from Dave, Sam and their great team. Nfonix is a native mobile applications development agency now focused on B2B products related to the learning sector. Here I focused on **Android** development primarily, but I also started working on **iOS** apps and
        managed to create end-to-end solutions with the first **Python and later Go** backends. 
        
        
        Being a small, fast-paced company working on a variety of projects at the same time, I got to
        mature into a **generalist mentality** and advance my knowledge in a range of different domains and programming languages, starting to code also on the backend for commercial projects.


        My first assignment was the end to end development of [Loyaltybook on Android](https://web.archive.org/web/20160208092928/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.loyaltybook), a customer loyalty rewards application with a gaming element, which only existed on iOS at the time. 
        That was a good segue to my previous startup experience and lots of fun as it had a lot of custom UI elements, although the company behind it is not in operation anymore.


        I later continued working on the Socrates project which is now the main product of the company, and since we were deploying it to prisons and secure learning environments and existing
        device lockdown solutions were quite expensive, I saw the opportunity to develop one in-house since we controlled the hardware, so I worked on a comprehensive MDM solution that
        included QR Code or USB automatic configuration and sync, restricted app and browsing capabilities, and device admin policies deployment. This was a **deep dive into Android system utilities and APIs and app security**
        and a very rewarding project in terms of learning (and business outcome), as I also got to develop a backend in **Flask and Mosquitto** (it sported custom push notifications via MQTT) which later was ported to
        **Go** for an easier 1-click binary deployment process.'

        end: 'Jan 2015'
        description: 'Here is where I learnt the ropes of mobile development, focusing on the ongoing redesign of the Soundtracker Android app at the time and the design, development and deployment to stores of
        the **Google Glass Soundtracker app** which featured on the original Google Store.
        
        
        Soundtracker was a **geo-localized music social network** that enabled users to build radio stations selecting across 32 millions tunes and stream it to nearby people and friends. 
        It achieved a good level of success during 2015, counting more than 500000 monthly users. It was later sold to a big music publishing company (Sounday) in late 2016.


        I remember the excitement of working in the development program with the Google Glass team and talking about our
        code directly to them. 
        
        
        Google Glass is not around as a consumer product anymore, but that was just the start as I adapted to work with a variety of devices, adapting the app to **Google TV (now Android TV),
        Amazon Kindle, the Barnes&Noble Nook device** and focused on automotive and **Android Auto** at some point.
        As my university dissertation I created a spin-off app, Soundtracker for Runners, an Android fitness tracker with an integrated music streaming and recommendation service,
        which talked to the Strava 3rd party APIs and ran on Google Glass as well.


        Sadly the company struggled to monetise the product, so the original team was disbanded but looking at the silver lining this was the prompt for me to move to Cambridge, UK

        description: 'The ESOLTHON was a hackathon over a weekend, kindly hosted by Makespace Cambridge. We were a team of 8, looking at challenges faced by people teaching English to refugees.
        We created a simple google sites website to host and filter the resources available for the teachers, in order to quickly find resources that match a certain language proficiency level.
        It was a great experience and a cross-functional team effort between education experts, software developers, language teachers and students.'
